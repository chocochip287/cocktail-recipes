## Specific-Project-tasks

Matt Goldsmith -  Project structure, technical organization, and stylization -
 connected the app's individual elements into a cohesive and functional user experience with supporting JavaScript functions and uniform presentation

Allan Elias - API call setup, local storage management/rendering and general debugging - got access to the API's used on the project, 
setup the local storage to access drink search history through a dropdown menu and fixed some styling bugs.

Angelica Ibarra - README Initiation and maintainence. Queried an API to pull jokes connecting programming to drinks, bartending and mixology and render them into a usable format for the app. 
Implemented the jokee data into leading/transition screen via HTML and JavaScript to introduce humor and levity into the user's experience.

Saeed Elmakki - Initial HTML draft and Final Presentation.
